## Who We Are

We're a group of developers who strive for finely-crafted, user-friendly software. 

## What We Do

Right now, we're primarily focused on developing Bukkit plugins.

## Our Standards

### Customization

Every message sent to a user should be translatable and customizable to the organization's preferences. Every feature should be toggleable.

### Cleanliness

Listeners, recipes, events, and such should only be registerred if the associated feature is enabled.

### Developer-Friendliness

Every project and commit should be written in such a way that it can easily be maintained and understood. Readability and clarity are valued over cleverness.
Every plugin should contain an API and use events where it is feasable.

### Documentation

Every plugin should be documented well and generate appropriate documentation. If supported by the language, documentation is to be included in every public-facing facet. Configurations should be well-commented and have additional explanations available online.
