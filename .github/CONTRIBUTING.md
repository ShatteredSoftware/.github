# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to any of the projects under ShatteredSuite, we ask that you follow the following if you want your changes to be merged.

## Code Principles

This is a set of guidelines we follow for our code to ensure that it is of the best quality and easy to use in any community where it is used.

### Customization

Every message sent to a user should be translatable and customizable to the organization's preferences. Every feature should be toggleable.

### Cleanliness

Listeners, recipes, events, and such should only be registerred if the associated feature is enabled.

### Developer-Friendliness

Every project and commit should be written in such a way that it can easily be maintained and understood. Readability and clarity are valued over cleverness.
Every plugin should contain an API and use events where it is feasable.

### Documentation

Every plugin should be documented well and generate appropriate documentation. If supported by the language, documentation is to be included in every public-facing facet. Configurations should be well-commented and have additional explanations available online.

## Code Style
We use the [Google Java Code Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). It is recommended that you use an editor that can automatically enforce this, or use a tool that will format your code to follow these guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

When contributing, we ask that you adhere to our code of conduct which can be found [here](https://github.com/ShatteredSuite/ShatteredSuite/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Failure to do so may result in rejected commits or a ban from contributing to the project. The Code of Conduct is enforced at the project owners' discretion.
